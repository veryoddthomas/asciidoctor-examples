Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots
in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years
old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good
and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for
those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et
Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

=== Code

This is a source listing for bash.  It demonstrates the use of <_n_> callouts.

[source, shell]
----
#! /bin/bash <1>
 
HOSTNAME=`uname -n`
KERNEL=`uname -r`
CPU=`uname -p`

figlet -f digital Welcome to $HOSTNAME! <2>
echo "You're running $KERNEL on $CPU"
----
<1> Hashbang is used to tell the shell which program to invoke
<2> Will fail if figlet is not installed

=== Verbatim

[#id-for-listing-block]
.Verbatim block title
----
Content in a listing block is subject to _verbatim_ *substitutions*.
Listing block content is commonly used to preserve code input.

== Equations

=== AsciMath (the default for STEM)

.A block with a basic square root using AsciiMath
[asciimath, id="myfirstequation"]
++++
sqrt(4) = 2

sum_(i=1)^n i^3=((n(n+1))/2)^2
++++

The expression in the block above can also be written inline.

stem:[sqrt(4) = 2]

and

stem:[sum_(i=1)^n i^3=((n(n+1))/2)^2]

Water (stem:[H_2O]) is a critical component.

A matrix can be written as stem:[[[a,b\],[c,d\]\]((n),(k))].

[stem]
++++
P = P_0 * ( ( (A * T_"Rt" + B - K_"sot") / (K_"tot" - K_"sot")) -1 )
++++

=== latexmath:[\LaTeX]

Inline LaTex (or latexmath:[\LaTeX]) looks like: 

latexmath:[C = \alpha + \beta Y^{\gamma} + \epsilon]

A block of LaTex looks like:

.A block of  LaTex 
[latexmath]
++++
C = \alpha + \beta Y^{\gamma} + \epsilon

++++

This is a reference back to the first equation, <<myfirstequation>>.
